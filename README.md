# word_to_number
Translating string of numbers to int/float 

How to use it:

* Write the number if you want in the right order
* Names that describe values that are less than one, like half or quarter are not supported yet. zero point five for example, is supported

EXAMPLE:
my_nuber = WordToNumber("forty five")
print(my_number.number) --> will print 45
