# word_to_number
Translating string of numbers to int/float 

How to use it:

* Write the number if you want in the right order
* Don't use plural (for now). for example: don't use ten thousands but use ten thuosand
* Names that describe values that are less than one, like half or quarter are not supported yet. zero point five for example, is supported
